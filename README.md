# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project performed a data analysis on several thousand crowdfunding projects to uncover any hidden trends for the theater plays category.


### Purpose

The purpose of this challenge is to analyze and compare how different theater campaigns performed based on their launch date and funding goal and create a chart to visualize trends over a period of time and goal ranges. 


## Analysis and Challenges
The scope is to evaluate the outcomes for theater plays based on funding goals and launch dates for theater plays. The analysis looked at how well plays performed relative to their launch date and funding goal from January to December.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The number of successful theater plays were highest in May and June with 111 and 100 successful plays, respectively. The number of successful plays began declining below 100 after June but still exceeded the number of failed and canceled plays between January and December.

The number of failed theater plays was highest when launched in May at 52 followed by October at 50.

The highest number of canceled theater plays were launched in January at 7 and the lowest in October when there were no cancellations. The number of canceled theater plays was below 10 and overall, relatively steady from January to December.



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The percentage of successful plays was highest when the goal amount was less than $1000 and lowest when the goal was between $45,000 to $49,999. In contrast, the percentage of failed plays was lowest for goals less than $1000 and highest for goals between $45,000 to $49,999. When the goal range was between $15,000 to $19,9999, the same percentage of plays succeeded and failed. The percentage of canceled plays does not appear to be correlated to goal amount but to launch date.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The biggest challenge was sorting the goal ranges for the outcomes based on goals chart. It required additional steps to select the chart, and then choose Chart Tools : Design > Select Data to configure the series only Percentage Successful, Percentage Failed, and Percentage Canceled.

In general, it was difficult to determine the exact font color and width for the charts based on the pictures in the challenge module.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
 
 Based on the data, the ideal time to launch theater plays is between January and August. December is not an optimal launch date as the number of successful (37) and failed (35) theater plays are almost even.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Campaign goals that are less than $1000 and up to $44,999, and between $35,000 and $44,999 ranges tend to perform better with higher percentages of successful theater plays.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

We did not examine the distribution of the outcomes for other categories other than theater plays and did not compare the outcomes for theater plays with other categories.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could create a table that looks at the mean and median  for goals and pledges for theater plays to see if there is an ideal target funding goal ranges.
